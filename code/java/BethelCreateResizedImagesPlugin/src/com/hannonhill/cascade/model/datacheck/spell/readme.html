   Sentry Spelling Checker Engine<BR>
   Java SDK<BR>
   Servlet Example</H1>
  <P>
   This directory contains an example program that implements a Java 
   servlet which checks the spelling of text submitted by a Web-based 
   client to a Web server. The servlet interacts with the client user to 
   dispose of any spelling errors detected.</P>
  <H3>
   How to build SpellingServlet</H3>
  <P>
   <FONT COLOR="RED"><B><I>IMPORTANT</I></B></FONT>: Before building 
   SpellingServlet, you must modify SpellingServlet.java to set your 
   license key. See the &quot;Getting Started&quot; chapter of the 
   Sentry Programmer's Guide for further instructions.</P>
  <P>
   Ensure the CLASSPATH setting includes the directory or JAR file 
   containing the Sentry class library (packages com.wintertree.ssce and 
   com.wintertree.util). Also, because the Java Servlet SDK (JSDK) is 
   not part of the JDK, you may need to include the JSDK class library 
   in your CLASSPATH.</P>
  <P>
   Run the following command:</P>
  <UL>
   <LISTING>
    javac SpellingServlet.java</LISTING>
   </UL>
  <P>
   Note that two versions of the Java Servlet API exist. One version 
   uses <B>getAttribute</B> and <B>setAttribute</B> methods to save and 
   retrieve state, while the other version uses <B>getValue</B> and <B>setValue</B> 
   methods. If error messages are displayed by the Java compiler 
   regarding <B>getAttribute</B> and <B>setAttribute</B> methods, edit 
   SpellingServlet.java and replace <B>getAttribute</B> with <B>getValue</B>,
    and <B>setAttribute</B> with <B>setValue</B>.</P>

   How to install and configure SpellingServlet</H3>
  <P>
   Instructions for setting up a servlet vary from server to server, so 
   consult your server's documentation for detailed instructions. You 
   will need to consider the following issues:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Where is the SpellingServlet.class file located, and how does the 
    server know where it is located? A common configuration is to create 
    a directory structure like this on the server's file system:</P>
   </UL><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>spellingservlet/<BR>    web-inf/<BR>        classes</PRE><P>
     The SpellingServlet.class file is copied to the web-inf/classes 
     directory. The Web server is configured to locate the servlet in the 
     spellingservlet directory. Again, your Web server may use a different organization.</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <UL>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Where are the .html files and lexicon files used by SpellingServlet 
    located? SpellingServlet reads some template HTML files at run-time, 
    and also opens lexicon files (ssceam.tlx and ssceam2.clx). These 
    files are accessed using the getResourceAsStream method of the 
    ServletContext class, and the files are accessed in the servlet's 
    root directory like this:</P>
   </UL><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>stream = getServletContext().getResourceAsStream(&quot;/ssceam.tlx&quot;);</PRE><P>
     Typically, these files would be located in the spellingservlet 
     directory, but you should consult your Web server's documentation for 
     information on how the servlet's root directory is located.</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <UL>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Where is the Sentry class library located? You may need to add the 
    location of the class library or ssce.jar file to your server's CLASSPATH.</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    How is SpellingServlet's URL configured? Some Web servers require (or 
    permit) a URL alias to be defined which maps to the server's 
    location, so the full path to the servlet doesn't have to be entered 
    in the URL that invokes it.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   Before SpellingServlet can be used, you must copy ssceam.tlx and 
   ssceam2.clx from the ssce/runtime/lex directory to SpellingServlet's 
   root directory (the same directory containing the .html files used by SpellingServlet).</P>
  <P>
   SpellingServlet does not currently use servlet initialization parameters.</P>
  <H3>
   SpellingServlet design</H3>
  <P>
   When SpellingServlet is initially invoked by a client, it responds 
   with the HTML contained in the file entryform.html. This file 
   contains a simple form with a text area and buttons labeled 
   &quot;Check Spelling&quot; and &quot;Submit.&quot; When the user 
   clicks the Check Spelling button, the form is POSTed to 
   SpellingServlet, which begins checking the spelling of text entered 
   in the form's text area.</P>
  <P>
   If a spelling error is detected, SpellingServlet returns the contents 
   of spellingform.html. This file contains a spelling-checker form 
   which shows the text being spell-checked (with the misspelled word 
   highlighted), suggested replacements for a misspelled word, a place 
   to enter a correction, and buttons to dispose of the spelling error: 
   Ignore, Ignore All, Change, and Change All. After the user disposes 
   of the spelling problem, the next spelling error is located and 
   spellingform.html is returned again.</P>
  <P>
   When all words in the text have been checked (or the user cancels the 
   spelling check by pressing the Stop Checking button in 
   spellingform.html), the contents of spellingcomplete.html is 
   returned, which displays the status of the spelling check and gives 
   the user the opportunity to submit the text to the server or continue 
   editing it.</P>
  <P>
   All buttons in the forms displayed by SpellingServlet which require 
   an action on the server have the same name (&quot;action&quot;) and 
   result in the form being posted to SpellingServlet. SpellingServlet 
   looks at the &quot;action&quot; button's value (i.e., its label) to 
   determine which button was pressed and therefore which action to 
   perform. Note that each button must have a different label for this 
   to work.</P>
  <P>
   The HTML returned to the client is read from an HTML template file. 
   Certain tokens in the file are replaced at run time with dynamic 
   value. This approach is simpler than generating HTML on the fly using 
   Java code, and has the added benefit of allowing the HTML template 
   file to be edited using an HTML editor.</P>
  <P>
   SpellingServlet may be invoked by more than one client 
   simultaneously, so issues relating to thread safety must be 
   considered. One instance of SpellingSession is created for each 
   servlet session, each time the Check Spelling button is pressed. Each 
   client therefore has its own SpellingSession, and SpellingSessions 
   are not shared among servlet sessions.</P>
  <P>
   For maximum thread safety, each instance of SpellingSession should 
   open its own set of lexicons, so lexicons are not shared among 
   servlet sessions. There are two drawbacks to this approach. First, 
   lexicons typically consume at least as much memory as their 
   corresponding files (the American English lexicon uses over 300K, for 
   example). A Web site hosting multiple simultaneous spelling checks 
   would need enough memory available to support all clients' lexicons. 
   The second drawback is that time is required to open lexicons and 
   load them into memory. If the text being checked was typically small 
   (less than 1K for example), the time required to check the spelling 
   of the text would be dwarfed by the initialization time.</P>
  <P>
   The approach used by SpellingServlet is to share lexicons among all 
   servlet sessions. Lexicons opened as InputStreams are safe, provided 
   words are not added to or removed from them at run time. 
   SpellingServlet's init method opens ssceam.tlx and ssceam2.clx as 
   InputStreams, which means the lexicons are safely sharable.</P>
  <P>
   A temporary MemTextLexicon is created for each servlet session when 
   the Check Spelling button is pressed. This temporary lexicon is not shared.</P>
