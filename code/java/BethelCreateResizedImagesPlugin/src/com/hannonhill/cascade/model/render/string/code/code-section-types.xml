	| This document enumerates the different specific XML comments that indidicate
	| sections of code embedded in files, blocks, pages, or templates. Upon publishing
	| to an appropriate serialization format these comments indicate what needs to happen
	| to the code embedded in them. For example, passthrough code sections simply indicate 
	| that when published the xml comments to be stripped leaving only the code embedded 
	| in the comments.
    
	| This was done for JIRA issue CSCD-850 which was occuring because characters in 
	| embedded in server-side scripting code were being escaped when the code was 
	| put in CDATA blocks.
	
	| The "top" code sections need to be listed first. This is to avoid problem where 
	| for example #protect-top would be considered a #protect tag with "-top" as 
	| a body of that tag.
