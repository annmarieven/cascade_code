### Wufoo
* Work with forms that don't have preload first  
* Preload might not be possible in Cascade

### Training 
* 2 day user training
    * Like a demo  
    * Video session instead of live March 10-11  
    * Everyone watch videos before February 25  
* Full day session
    * In depth, personalized training  
    * **Scheduled: February 25**  
* Our team
    * Give video links to Cindy, Sue, Gruber, Tim, etc.  
    * Deadline for watching videos by the time KL, AMV, and Jameson hold training session  
    * Should we decide on a date for team training?  

### Beautification
* Probably can't change interface  

### Images
* No updates here.  
* **Next steps**  
    * Decide how we want non-technical people to use/access images  
    * See what we want to do and assess what Cascade already has built out  
    * Image management might stay with us for higher up sites
