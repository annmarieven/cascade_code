## Meeting 03.10.14
Erik, Jameson, Jake, KL, AnnMarie

### CAS Academics
* Jake worked on getting data definition set up
* Jake also worked on velocity and xml
* All the data from the data definition is on the page, now we just need to style it
    * Way to go Jake!!
* Jake will style for current template, new template, and responsive
* Jake will work on automatically grabbing faculty bios so they appear on the page
* KL will get faculty bios figured out

### Images
* AMV and KL talked about images this morning
    * Process looks good (what Jake and KL had decided)
    * Download from FLickr, upload original to Cascade, crop and choose aspect ratio, multiple photo sizes are generated based on ratio
* Central image folder
    * More top level categories rather than intricate mapping system for folder structure
    * Jake and Jameson say don't use folders - just load all images with flat architecture
    * Rather than reusing images we just keep loading new ones
* Organizing by general categories rather than content types or site structure
    * Student life, campus shots, etc.
* KL will look into roles and image management
* KL will look into metadata for images so we can do alt text
### This Week
* KL will look at roles, workflows, and calendars
* How do we run 2 calendars? Or Do we have to get the entire calendar moved over before we launch?
* We need a plan for the about section when we're doing shared content
    * KL started a github discussion about this
    * https://github.com/betheluniversity/cascade/issues/27
