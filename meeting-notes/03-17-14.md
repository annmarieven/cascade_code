## Meeting 03.17.14
Erik, Jake, Jameson, AMV

### In-line editing for blocks
* Click on block and it opens a new window to edit
* Probably don't want it turned on for all blocks (maybe some things we don't want an author to update)
* Anyone can still get to the block by clicking the 'edit' tab
* Error message when you choose the wrong kind of block (for example, video/image block and you choose a wufoo form, it won't appear)

### Images
* Almost done!
* Click on folder, click "gallery" below the view tab and you can see small thumbnails of each image

### CAS Academics
* Erik and AMV will meet to work on Chemistry this week
* Jake is still working on page design
