### Responsive Images
* Jake and Jame-o are working on it

### CAS Academics
* AMV and Erik loaded Chemistry faculty and majors/minors
* How do we handle majors/minors? 
    * Pull content onto main department pages 
    * What if there is one major/minor with a full page of info? How do we link to it with a wrong url?
    * Put chemistry majors and minors in undergrad/academics/majors-minors folder
* Erik is trying to get content back by next Friday
* 
### Events
* Any way we could get Chemistry to have the ability to post events before everything else is ready?
* Setup event feed on current site - AMV

### Maps and Directions
* Reasonable quote back from cartographer
* New ariel shots
* 2-D map of campus
* 3-D map of campus and Pine Tree
* 60 days till we have it - not in time for our power build out
* We can prep what Mathias did with Google Maps and just put the map overlays on when we get them
