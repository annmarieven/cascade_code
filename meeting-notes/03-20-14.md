## Meeting Notes 03.20.14
Erik, Jake, Jameson, Vedders, AMV
### Responsive Images
* Jake and Jame-o are working on it
* Demo on Monday

### CAS Academics
* AMV and Erik loaded Chemistry faculty and majors/minors
* How do we handle majors/minors? 
    * Pull content onto main department pages 
    * What if there is one major/minor with a full page of info? How do we link to it with a wrong url?
    * Put chemistry majors and minors in undergrad/academics/majors-minors folder
* Erik is trying to get content back by next Friday

### Events
* Any way we could get Chemistry to have the ability to post events before everything else is ready?
* Setup event feed on current site - AMV

### Maps and Directions
* Reasonable quote back from cartographer
* New ariel shots
* 2-D map of campus
* 3-D map of campus and Pine Tree
* 60 days till we have it - not in time for our power build out
* We can prep what Mathias did with Google Maps and just put the map overlays on when we get them

### Enrollment and the web
* From 2011-2012 to 2012-2013 we are down site visits by 10%
    * A lot of different variables at play here - we were rocking SEO and maybe others are now catching up, we shrunk content from 49,000 to 19,000 pages
* Everything we're doing should be to help and support admissions and the funnel process
* *If our focus should be on the top of the funnel and driving people to our site then our work needs to shift from making postcards to making our site better*
