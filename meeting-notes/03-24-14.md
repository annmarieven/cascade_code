## Meeting 03.24.14
Tim, Jake, Jameson, Mike, AMV

### CAS Academics Faculty
* Teaching specialty? -- business faculty have this but there isn't space for it in Cascade. Should we just add it to "Add to your Bio" area?
* Add teaching specialty to "add to your bio" but field should appear above 'expertise'
* We have to figure out how to set these up so we can let people in and give control while keeping tabs on them

### Responsive Images
* Load image, crop the image by dragging on photo (don't hit the crop button first)
* Choose image on page, doesn't matter the size
* Image size is chosen based on size of element container, not browser window size
* Is not allowing our web authors to do responsive images a good idea? If our solution is too technical it will all be on our team and we are not going to get more resources.
* We need to let our web authors be able to do images well
* We can't continue to be in total control of everything because people are going to keep demanding more of us
* **Possible Solutions**
    * Base asset is loaded wherever the web author loads, responsive images get created in shared content folder but the web author only needs to point to the base asset

### Maps
* Jameson is wading through Mathias' stuff
* Google has updated their API
