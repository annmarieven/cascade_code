## Meeting Notes 03.24.14
Tim, Jake, Jameson, Mike, AMV

### CAS Academics Faculty
* Teaching specialty? -- business faculty have this but there isn't space for it in Cascade. Should we just add it to "Add to your Bio" area?
* Add teaching specialty to "add to your bio" but field should appear above 'expertise'

### Responsive Images
* Load image, crop the image by dragging on photo (don't hit the crop button first)
* Choose image on page, doesn't matter the size
* Image size is chosen based on size of element container, not browser window size
