## Meeting 03.27.14
Erik, Jake, Jameson, AMV

### CAS Academics
* Most of the content is being pulled onto the page. Jake is working on design 
* AMV add a business page
* We're kind of a stand still now to see if we're going with one page or multiple
* Event feed isn't working on Chemsitry homepage

### Responsive Images
* For each image size they need 2-3 pixel densities so for every one image we'll have 8-12 additional images
* Jameson found a solution so the additional images will be handled outside of Cascade but only the original will remain in Cascade
* The additional images won't be created until it's requested for the first time
* Look at process for how our users upload images and where they them
* Images are set to auto-publish if they live in the shared-content folder so we'd have to somehow create a copy of images in the shared-content folder if they are loaded elsewhere
