## Meeting 04.28.14
Erik, Jake, Jame-o, KL, AMV

### Calendar
* Where is this in the priority list?
* Our desire is that after about and chemistry launch we hold on starting other sites until the calendar is done

### CAS Academics
* Ready to go - pretty much.
* Jake has to work on the quote carousel and the 'what you can do with this department' section
    * That section will be difficult if there are not always 3 lists
* Remove "Top" from proof points -- http://programs.xp.bethel.edu/undergraduate/academics/chemistry/index.php
* Add shared text and title to Faculty page
* Chemistry major/minor only has minor information
* Admissions buttons
* Workflows set up
* Split data definition - KL
* Should we make the 'what can you do' section its own page? -- KL & Gruber think about if we'd need an individualized blurb for every department to direct them to the page

### About
* Homepage still needs work

### Navigation
* Remove index page from left hand nav (so majors and minors doesn't show up under majors and programs)
* Indicate which page is active in left hand nav
* Not all majors/minors are showing up in the left hand nav
* Indicate which area is active in the gray school nav
