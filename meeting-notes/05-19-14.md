## Meeting 05.19.14

### About
* Looks good!
* Erik is going to look at content one more time. Check proof points to make sure they are the ones we want to pull.
* Crop images if it needs to be in a wysiswyg - responsive images won't work in a wysiwyg
* Jake and Jame-o will see if there is a way to get the Thumbor link in the wysiwyg
    * Can we turn off image insertion?
    * Can people still drag and drop?
