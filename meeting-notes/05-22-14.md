###Migration plan  
Main focus - Events, calendar and all sites that use events and viewers

####Calendar and Event Pages
Get submission form, Cascade events viewer, and calendar view done by July 10.


Once form is live, everyone in the community will use the new submission form so that they have the ability to edit their events after they've been submitted. They build out the calendar so event migration is minimal (web services will take care of summer events and any events that were populated pre-June).

After July 10, start launching sites that use viewers.

####What this means
Event freeze from now until July 10. Remove submission button. See if athletics can hold until then.

AnnMarie is focused on training and access/workflows/etc.

CAS academic loading is going to Allie - June and July

Seminary will not happen this summer
