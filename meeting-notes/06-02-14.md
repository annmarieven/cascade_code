## Meeting 06.12.14

### CAS Academics
* Are we dropping department name? Mike says YES.
* No html in department highlights because it's a limited wysiwyg.
    * KL - test this to see if it's set up by user group
    * Can we change it for loading and then change it back once it's all loaded? YES. AMV will change to unlimited wysiwyg and we will see if we want to turn them back on once we're done with the main chunk of laoding
* How are proof points being pulled onto department pages?
    * Need at least 1 from the specific department
    * If there's only 1 department proof point, then it pulls a random school one
    * Add another tag in the topic section for the best proof points to be pulled as generic academic ones
