### Tinker
* Should the 'not approved' button show a preview of the page?
* Change default time to 8 a.m.? - suggestion by Cindy
* It's not clear what should go in the directions box - suggestion by Cindy

### Basic Plus
* Pages with 'main image' have a full column image at the top. Many pages don't need a full column image though --
