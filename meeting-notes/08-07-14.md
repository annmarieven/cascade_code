### Training

* Proof point training week of Aug 18
* Academic training starts week of Sept 8

### CAS Academics
* Launched
* Looking at Honors to see if it fits the department template or needs a different site
* News/event feeds
* Shared majors
    * Come back to these (not high priority)
    * AMV to follow up with Lauren about choosing the primary department
* When do we move the rest of academics?
    * Use Allie and Sergio to do some of these pages
    * Save department index and majors/minors index so these can be setup dynamically
* Majors with bad names
    * Ex: Biokinetics - exercise science
    * Do we enter multiple names in the metadata?
    * Do we create a fake page that redirects?
* Special Sections
    * Alumni stories - a lot of people have requested this and we don't have the ability for this yet
    * Everything else was like galleries, videos, basic pages
    * WBCS streaming for Communication Studies -- still in old Silva

### News
* Let's get the data definition up and running so we can test migration
* Jake will work on styling after we test migration
* Can we NOT migrate publications that we don't produce anymore? -- Mike
* Can we get the architecture moved over or issue things moved into blocKs?
