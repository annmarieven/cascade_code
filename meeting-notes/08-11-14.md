* Faculty bios
    * Groups were removed and content is lost
    * Do NOT publish faculty pages within cas academics
    * Will wait to see if Caleb can recreate group structure
    * Jame-o will decide if removing the group structure is worth it (does it just make Tinker easier to build or actually more stable?)
* Majors/minors

    * KL will work with Mark to come up with something that generates a list
