## Meeting 08.18.14

### CAS Academics
* General education launches today
* Honors launches today
* Theatre
    * Kristen Soderman asked about including a link to production archive in old Silva
    * She can talk to Lauren (first give Lauren a heads up)
    * Special section and Kristen can build it once she gets trained
* Faculty pages
    * Lauren was concerned with faculty not seeing education on their bio listing
    * Launch full faculty pages by end of this week (without photos)
    * AMV create a github to have Eric work on linking up listing to full bio pages
    * Plan how to proof formatting on every bio page as they launch (paragraph tags, headings, etc.)
    * Index page be a searchable directory - maybe we don't have time for this yet?
* Majors/minors
    * Buttons display side by side for majors that also have a minor and/or program
    * Text link goes to major (trumps minor/program)
    * Include default text on major page and point people to minor/program

### News and Events
* Goal is to have them up by the end of August when homepages launch
* Mike wants event feeds on academic pages by the time we send communication to faculty
* Eric is adding event feed to template and will send to Jake today
* Possible event placement -- below majors/minors
* Publish in future
    * Can we use a publish set and start date on the news story?
    * How does smart publishing fit into this?
    * If smart publishing is on can we still manually publish articles? - KL will look into this

### Redirects
* Redirects will be applied right away (temporarily until we upgrade our servers)
* If this is too slow, contact Jame-o
* Add a trigger for an email to be sent to webmaster@bethel.edu (apply to all workflows)
* Create documentation on how to do redirects
* AMV possibly needs to be the one to submit all redirects (schedule a time for KL and AMV to work on workflow)
