## Meeting 08.25.14
### Academics - Faculty
* List order
    * 2 emeritus showing up at top of list for history
    * Just leaving as alphabetical for now (not an easy fix)
    * Will look at again if multiple departments have issues with it
* Job titles (only 1st one appears)
    * Make department chair first job title as temporary fix
    * If we want multiple job titles to show up, we'll need to change the way the listing is formatted (hold on this until we get more requests about it)

### Images
* Smart publishing isn't working the way we want it to
* Change workflow to autopublish the file rather than trigger the publish set

### Academics - Events
* Check with Jake to see if it's worth it to create an event feed for every department instead of coding it into the format
* Select the heading and heading class in the event feed
* See if Caleb is going to add the fields to the data definition
* Check with Jake on what those fields should be and what the styles/classes should be
