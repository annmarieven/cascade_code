## Meeting 08.28.14

### News channel in Blink
* Jameson is going to create an iframe

### Home Stories, Carousel, Event Feeds, News Feeds, etc.
* We have lots of different feeds/viewers
* Could we make one that you can choose the content type, metadata you want to show, and way you want to view it?
* Jake is concerned that this is making one thing too much
* How do we find ways to get stories on different pages?
    * We want to use these in other places besides just the homepage
    * Mike wants to be able to use a history story on the history department page
    * We'll use carousels and not make a multi-faceted feed/viwer (too much work right now)
    
### CAS Academics
* Create site features to link to old Silva sites for now
* Special sections section in department data def might be going away (not in format yet)
* Faculty Listings
    * Humanities, Honors, CWILT all want faculty listings but they're not listed in metadata (except honors)
    * Do we make it departments and programs?
        * Then everything would either need to be a department or a program
* Event feeds
    * Jake is getting the first one done
    * All of them up and running by end of day tomorrow
