Erik, Jameson, Jake, KL, Vedders, AnnMarie  
**Install - Jameson**  
* Test XP mimics production as much as possible  
* Production CMS  
* Dev for developers  
* Fail over “silent” in case Prod goes down  

**Transfer  - Jameson**  
* Universal migration tool - Jameson still figuring it out  
* Figure out transfer before transferring vs. transfer all content and then figure out in Cascade  

**Architecture**  
* Mike will share 2 versions of proposed IA  
* Mike will get omni license for AnnMarie’s computer  
* How flat do we get? bethel.edu/undergrad/academics/biology or bethel.edu/undergrad/biology  
* KL will look at flattening the architecture and bring something on Thursday  

**Training**  
* When do we schedule?  
* 1 ½ days of training  
    * Half day of basic Cascade training with lots of other users. 
    * Full day is just us and them. Maybe some basics, and some technical, but we drive this session.  
* Mike will talk to them and schedule possibly in mid or end of February. AnnMarie is out of town Feb 12-19.  

**Beautification**  
* Any way to “beautify” Cascade on the inside? Jameson will look into it  
* Ask Hannon Hill if they want to pay us to make it more user friendly?
